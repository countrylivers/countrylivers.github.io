    <h1>About Country Livers</h1>
    <p>Country Livers is a group created for researching about country living.
    There are many facets concerning country living and it is a very wide field.
    The seventh day adventists are majorly inclined towards this field: because
    they believe that soon a crisis is going to break upon them.
    Others want to move to the country side because they are looking for a place to retire
    from the city rush and life, this especially falls under the category of the older generation.
    And also they're those who want to move to the country set up because they love the simplicity
    and feel of nature which affords them a number of lessons to learn from, and get closer to the Creator.
    I don't know which category you fall under but one thing is for sure this
    site is built for you.
